# Contributing to Portfolio-Improved

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
All code changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.

## Reporting Bugs üêõ

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Share the exact commands you used
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests üöÄ

We welcome feature requests! Here's how to submit one:

1. Check existing issues to see if the feature has been suggested before
2. Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature
3. Explain why this feature would be valuable to most users
4. Optional: Provide mockups or prototypes
